This is the very first version. made a JOke about this. 
it is in a state of calling your friend to tell them what game number you are in so that you both can be playing the same game. lmau. 
and of course you have to know the only 2 valid player IDs. any player ID will log you into the game but, invalid player IDs only allow you to spectate.
this is a fun version that I would like to keep. as bare bone as it is. extra features can be added but the ID above will be retained. I can decide to start getting the passcode from 
an ENV or a DB, encrypted with keys from ENV to ensure the IDs are changeable by me. can also set match ID to time and minute and make it accessible from a recent list. posibility s 
endless. Idea is the same.###
